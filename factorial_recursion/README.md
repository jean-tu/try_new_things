We had learned about recursion in class and how we would be able to do programs using recursion. It makes the program look much cleaner and easy to understand because there is a base case condition that must be met eventually. Once the base case has been met, then it will break out of the program. 

To compile the file do: 
	g++ -g -Wall factorial.cpp -o factorial 
To run the program: 
	./factorial
Then it will ask you for a number that you would like to find the factorial for and you just enter in an integer! 
Then the answer is presented on the terminal!!
